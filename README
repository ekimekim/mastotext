A text-based command line client app for the Mastodon social network.

Primary concepts:
* Scrolling real-time timeline
* Tooting is low-friction
* Keyboard shortcuts

Since this project seems to be attracting some attention (which is great :D),
I'd like to make this point clear: This is not yet working software.
I'll try to keep this README updated with latest status.
Right now, the extent of the software is the ability to log in and display basic info.

In the meantime, please feel free to leave thoughts or feature requests in the Issues tab,
or drop me a line at @ekimekim@mstdn.io

Next goal:
* Able to connect to a Mastodon instance and print last 10 toots on timeline
